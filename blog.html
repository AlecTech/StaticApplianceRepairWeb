                <li>Inspect the hoses</li>
                <p>Every month or so, make sure there are no bulges or cracks and the fittings are tight</p>
                <li>Don’t overload it</li>
                <p>Oversize loads can damage your washer, so break up your laundry into smaller loads</p>
                <li>Use the right type of detergent</li>
                <p>Make sure you’re
                    using the right kind for your model. Many energy-efficient washers require a low-sudsing
                    detergent</p>
                <li>Clean the interior and dispensers</li>
                <p>Yes, you need
                    to wash the washer. This will help keep it clean and smelling fresh. TIP! Every month or
                    so, run an empty load of hot water with 2 cups of white vinegar. In the middle of the
                    wash cycle, add ½ cup of detergent. Let the full cycle complete.</p>
                <li>Wipe down the drum, door and gasket</li>
                <p>Doing this
                    once a month will help ensure the washer won’t give off odors that can seep into your
                    laundry. TIP! Use equal parts water and vinegar to clean the gasket</p>

                <h1>Dryer Maintenance Tips</h1>
                <li>Clean the dryer’s interior</li>
                <p>Even if you’re good about removing lint from the filter after every load, it’s common 
                    for lint to build up within the dryer, too. Once per year, disassemble the dryer and 
                    use a vacuum and a long vacuum hose attachment to clean out the lint.</p>
                <li>Check the area around the dryer’s vent cap outside</li>
                <p>Remove restrictions such as snow or leaves and clear shrubbery to enable proper air flow.</p>
                <li>Clear the dryer venting tube. </li>
                <p>Your dryer’s entire venting system should be cleaned out from the inside of the dryer to 
                    the outside vent cap at least once per year. Professionals can be hired for this job but 
                    it’s usually a simple do-it-yourself job.</p>
                <li>Remove lint from the lint filter, after every cycle </li>
                <p>Yes, every cycle. It’s that important. Also, once per season, use a long-handle brush or 
                    vacuum attachment to remove lint from the filter’s chute, too.</p>
                <li>Pay attention to drying time.</li>
                <p>If it’s taking longer for clothes to dry, it’s likely that lint is clogging the venting 
                    system and a thorough cleanout should happen a.s.a.p. Consider Lint Alert. It monitors 
                    for lint build-up and other blockage – alerting you if there is an air flow restriction 
                    in your dryer vent that could lead to a buildup of carbon monoxide in your home.</p>

                                your dishwasher is free from excess buildup is by running it regularly. Using your
                                dishwasher frequently will keep debris from settling in the bottom of the appliance and
                                can help reduce the amount of times that you will have to give it a thorough cleaning
                                throughout the year. </p>

                                following tips, it’s important that you run your dishwasher through a full cycle and
                                then empty all of the dishes from the appliance. This allows you to have easier access
                                to the entire dishwasher and be able to perform the necessary maintenance correctly.

                                work by spraying water out of their spinning arms onto the dishes inside. When those
                                arms aren’t spinning properly or the holes in them are full of buildup, your dishes
                                won’t be getting thoroughly cleaned. Check to make sure that the arms spin correctly and
                                clean out any debris that has accumulated inside the holes with a small piece of wire, a
                                toothpick, or small pliers. </p>

                                from the outside areas around the appliance. The edges around the door do not get washed
                                during a regular cycle and can end up with lots of spills and pieces of food debris.
